## Objectives for the project:

Take this frontend I prepared for a past project and develop a backend to allow the project to be easily managed by the clients.

My client need to serve products over this website to their own clients. The content served to these paying customers should only be acessible to them, not other people. 

My client needs to be able to create the pages to serve this content, add the content to said page, and also create the non-admin accounts and assign to these accounts the necessary permissions, all through the django-admin page.
